# CodeChallenge
This repository consists of two coding tasks:

1. **format-categories** : format nested category object to flat list of objects
2. **list-paginated-data** : application to list paginated data in JSON format

Detailed information about each is found in the corresponding README files.

All the code included here is developed and tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
